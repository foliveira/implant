# IMPLANT
#### *Android Platform for Augmented Reality Applications Development*

====

## Purpose

This was my final course project and an experience with augmented reality on the Android platform

## Instalation

This was based on (as of 2012) outdated version of both the Android operating system (1.6) and the corresponding Native Development Kit (NDK), so there's no instalation guide provided.
